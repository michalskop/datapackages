# Research on users of VolebniKalkulacka.cz's (VAA) during Presidential elections 2013 in the Czech Republic

The data from a research conducted among users of voting advice application [Volební kalkulačka](https://VolebniKalkulacka.cz). It is weighted so the 1st round of the real elections and the 2nd round of the real elections match the 1st and the last round of the hypothetical [instant-runoff voting (alternative vote) electoral system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting).
